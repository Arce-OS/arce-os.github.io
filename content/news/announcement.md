Today we proudly and excitedly announce the formation of
Rust-Edu, an organization dedicated to Rust education.

**MISSION** — We are committed to promote the adoption of Rust
throughout the academic world. We believe that we can work with the Rust
community to provide tools and educational support for students and
faculty to learn and build in new and better ways. In doing so, we will
drive the adoption of Rust as a key technology for years to come. While
we are initially focused on college level learning, long term, we hope
to broaden our scope.

**GOALS** — We have identified three types of initiative that we want to
take on:

*   **Create a Rust-based Curriculum** — Our initial effort is focused
    on creating a modular turnkey Rust curriculum for college-level
    Computer Science courses. Starting with an Introductory
    Programming course, we want to build Rust-based modules and entire
    courses covering traditional Computer Science topics such as
    Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Embedded Development,
    and Networking.

*   **Make Learning Rust Easier** — We want to leverage the growing
    interest in building tools that make learning and mastering Rust
    easier. We believe that the notorious difficult learning curve of
    the language can be overcome with better tooling for education.

-   **Make Rust More Developer Friendly** — We want to provide feedback
    to the Rust Project itself, helping to make Rust a more learnable
    language for developers. We would like to identify places where we
    can help with syntax, tooling, documentation, exercises,
    and error messages.

**WHO WE ARE** — We are a group of academics and community
members wanting to make progress and provide focus and
support for Rust Education, in an environment that warmly
welcomes all of those who wish to work and play in this
grand endeavor.

**GET INVOLVED** — We are extraordinarily grateful to
Futurewei, Inc for funding this initial work: if you want to
contribute financially, please let us know. Also, if you are
involved in Rust and academia, or would like to be, we would
love to have your help. Please visit us at

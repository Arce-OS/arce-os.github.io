The [Rust-Edu](http://rust-edu.org) Org 2022 Rust Education
Workshop, a one-day virtual meeting to discuss the future of
Rust education, was held 20 August 2022.

* Workshop [Proceedings](proceedings.pdf)
* Archived [Call For Participation](cfp-2022.html)

Topics discussed included

* The future of Rust as a language of choice in college CS
  education. We are particularly interested in the use of
  Rust as a teaching language in courses that are not
  directly language related: for example operating systems,
  networking, or embedded programming. We are also
  interested in the future potential of Rust as an early CS
  teaching language.

* Tool-driven and content-driven methods for improving Rust
  learning in general: for example tools for improving Rust
  code understanding, enhancements to existing tools to aid
  Rust learnability, or Rust teaching and tutoring content
  and frameworks.

* Possible enhancements to the Rust language and Rust
  Project tooling to improve learnability.

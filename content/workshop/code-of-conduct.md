title = "Rust Education Workshop: Code of Conduct"
+++

The Rust Education Workshop is intended to be an inclusive,
welcoming workshop for everyone. In particular, we do not
tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form.
Workshop participants violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the workshop at the discretion
of the workshop organizers.

Harassment includes disparaging verbal comments related to
gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or
religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate
intimidation; stalking; sustained disruption of talks or
other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome
sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing
behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or expulsion from the
workshop. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
contact a member of workshop staff immediately.
